// ft-pointer: the universal 3D mouse's brain (OpenVR overlay client, runs in the dev container).
//
// input-relay.py (pointer mode) sends mouse commands here; this program keeps the
// cursor, does collision against SteamVR's overlays, draws the free-space dot, and
// sends the ft_pointer driver the exact pose of its virtual controller.
//
//   relay -> @ft_pointer_helper -> ft-pointer -> @ft_pointer -> ft_pointer driver (inside vrserver)
//
// Cursor model:
//   - anchor: head position at the last recenter; yaw/pitch: direction from it (mouse-driven).
//   - Every frame a ray from the anchor is tested against every visible overlay
//     (ComputeOverlayIntersection). On a hit the cursor sits on that surface; otherwise
//     it floats `distance` metres out and a small dot overlay is shown there, which the
//     laser can hit, so SteamVR never draws a free-flying laser.
//   - Then the line of sight from the eye (not the anchor) to that point is tested too:
//     after the head moves, something nearer can cover the point, and the cursor goes on
//     whatever you see under it (panels close together in view, at different depths).
//   - Looks: the compositor ignores live changes to dashboard.laserRayWidthScale (only
//     the dashboard's own Settings screen reloads it), so the beam can't be switched
//     off per device. Instead the laser starts POINTER_ORIGIN_FRACTION (0.95) of the way
//     from the eye to the cursor, along the line of sight: what's left of the beam is a
//     few centimetres long and effectively invisible, and SteamVR's hit dot (sized by
//     distance from the origin) becomes tiny. Our own white dot is the visible cursor
//     everywhere: a non-interactive dot on panels (the laser passes through it), and an
//     interactive one in free space (the laser lands on it instead of flying off).
//   - The controller ray starts at the eye and aims at the cursor point. Everything here
//     is computed in the standing universe; the pose sent to the driver is converted to
//     SteamVR's raw tracking space (drivers report raw poses; on the Frame the standing
//     origin is ~1.6 m above the raw one, so sending standing coordinates put the laser
//     origin 1.6 m above the head). While our device
//     owns the dashboard pointer, dashboard.laserRayWidthScale is 0 so only the dot shows.
//     It's restored when a controller takes the pointer back.
//
// Headset off: when SteamVR says nobody is wearing the headset, the pointer is released and
// stays off until it's worn again, so the displays can sleep (see the main loop). While the
// pointer is off the helper also stops listing overlays with vrcmd, whose connection every
// second kept SteamVR from going to standby.
//
// Last used wins: when a real controller moves (picked up), the pointer is released
// (driver "hide", which also drops its hand role hint), so the controller gets
// its role and laser back. The next mouse input reconnects and claims the laser again.
// Moving means faster than 0.35 m/s or 2 rad/s, both times POINTER_CONTROLLER_PICKUP,
// for 100 ms in a row with the controller tracked normally: a single sample over the
// limit was enough before, and controllers resting on a desk released the pointer on a
// knock or a tracking jump.
// SteamVR gives a contested hand role to the most recently used device, and a held
// Frame controller counts as used (touch sensors). If our device hasn't got the hand
// role within a second of waking, the pointer is released (no orphan white dot) and
// mouse input can't wake it again for 2 s.
//
// Laser mode: with the dashboard closed, SteamVR keeps its laser mouse off until a
// click (the first click on a panel only turned it on, the second one clicked), and a
// laser that leaves every panel turns it off again. While the pointer is awake, the
// helper shows frametop.pointer.lasermode: a transparent 1 mm overlay 50 m below the
// head with VROverlayFlags_MakeOverlaysInteractiveIfVisible, which keeps SteamVR's
// laser mouse mode on as long as it's visible. It's hidden whenever the pointer is
// released, so controllers and VR games get the normal behaviour back.
//
// Tilt: while the left button is held (dragging a panel by its grab bar, which SteamVR
// moves rigidly with the controller), pressing the right button enters tilt mode. The
// right press is not forwarded; mouse motion then rotates the virtual controller around
// the grab point (horizontal: about the vertical axis, vertical: about the view's
// horizontal axis), so the panel turns around that pivot. The tilt accumulates for the
// whole drag: after the right button is released, the rotation stays applied (about the
// moving cursor point) so the grabbed panel keeps its new orientation, and pressing right
// again continues from it. Releasing the left button drops the panel; the tilted pose (and
// the drag lock) are held 0.5 s longer, because SteamVR's dashboard finishes a floating
// move up to 150 ms after the release (UndockedOverlay.endFloatingWindowMove measures the
// push distance first) and reads the controller pose again then.
//
// Scene-graph overlays: the dashboard's dock (valve.steam.gamepadui.bar) and the controls
// under floating windows (valve.steam.gamepadui.floatingfooter, undock and friends) have
// no texture (0x0) and a placeholder width, so ComputeOverlayIntersection never hits
// them. For those the ray is tested against the overlay's plane, within
// POINTER_SCENE_RADIUS (0.5 m) of its origin; the laser-catching dot sits 5 cm behind the
// plane, so the laser reaches the buttons and still lands on the dot between them.
// Only absolutely placed 0x0 overlays count as scene-graph: gamescope's app panels (the
// desktops) also report 0x0, but they're placed as dashboard tabs, stay up when the
// dashboard closes, and ComputeOverlayIntersection hits them normally.
//
// SteamVR Settings (a workaround for that page only): Steam's pages (Library and the rest)
// are drawn in valve.steam.gamepadui.main, a dashboard overlay ComputeOverlayIntersection hits
// exactly. SteamVR's Settings page isn't: the main overlay is hidden, and the page is drawn by
// the scene-graph panel (valve.steam.gamepadui.frame.menu.N), whose shape OpenVR doesn't give
// out. Its transform's plane isn't the page's surface, which is nearer, so the laser, starting
// a few cm in front of where we thought the page was, started behind it: most of the page
// took no clicks, which went through to a desktop screen behind, and the page covered our
// dot. So while the cursor is on that page (OnSettingsPage), the laser starts near the eye
// (SETTINGS_ORIGIN) and SteamVR's own hit test finds the page; our dot is drawn close in front
// (SETTINGS_DOT), and the laser-catching dot sits far behind everything (SETTINGS_CATCHER),
// invisible and with SteamVR's hit dot hidden, so it can't cover the page. The beam and
// SteamVR's hit dot on the page then look like a controller's. Everywhere else nothing
// changes.
//
// Panel edges: off a panel, the cursor stays on that panel's plane while it's within
// POINTER_EDGE_REACH (0.3 m) of the last point it touched, instead of jumping to
// POINTER_DISTANCE. A floating panel's resize margins and the window controls under it
// sit just outside the panel, and the laser has to start in front of that plane to reach
// them (a controller's laser always does: it starts at the hand). Like on scene-graph
// planes, the laser-catching dot sits 5 cm behind the plane.
//
// Drag lock: while the left button is held, the cursor keeps the distance it had at the
// press and collision is frozen, so dragging past a panel's edge (resizing, moving)
// doesn't jump the cursor to free space or swap in the laser-catching dot, which made
// SteamVR's resize snap back.
//
// Head follow (experimental, off by default; POINTER_FOLLOW=1, or the relay's "follow toggle"): the cursor
// is carried by a reference direction, where the head faced when it last settled, and turns
// with it, keeping its offset (mouse movement changes the offset, up to POINTER_FOLLOW_REACH,
// 70 deg, so the cursor can sit in a corner of the view). While the head stays within
// POINTER_LEASH_DEG (10) of the reference, nothing moves on its own: the cursor stays put in
// the room. Once the head has been past the leash for POINTER_LEASH_DELAY (0.2 s; a glance
// out and back doesn't count), the reference follows: it eases toward the head's facing with a
// time constant of POINTER_LEASH_RETURN (0.2 s), never falling further behind than the leash
// (or than it already was), until it lands on the facing, and the cursor is back where it was
// in the view. Then it waits for the leash again. Earlier tries: dragging the reference only at
// the leash's end left it up to the leash off after turning back (getting it centred took an
// overshoot), and easing it all the time moved the cursor on every small head movement. At 0
// the reference is the head's facing, so the cursor is head-locked. Head roll is ignored (the
// frames have no roll), so tilting the head doesn't swing the cursor. The ray origin (the
// anchor) moves to the eye with the reference, so leaning inside the leash doesn't move the
// cursor either. While the left
// button is held (and the drop hold after it), the leash still moves the reference but the
// cursor stays put in the room, so a click or a drag can't be nudged by the head; the offset
// is taken up from where the cursor is when the hold ends, so it doesn't jump.
//
// Gaze mode (experimental, off by default; POINTER_GAZE=1, "gaze on|off|toggle", or the
// relay's gaze_toggle): the pointer goes where you look, and the mouse does the last bit
// (MAGIC pointing: Zhai, Morimoto and Ihde, CHI 1999). The gaze service (gaze/ft-gazed)
// sends the corrected gaze 90 times a second, "gz <yaw> <pitch> <raw yaw> <raw pitch>"
// (head-relative degrees), and while the gaze has the pointer, the cursor ray is simply
// that gaze from the eye: nothing is steered, so nothing can pile up. Moving the mouse takes
// the pointer from the gaze, and it moves from where the gaze left it, as usual. Looking
// well away from it (more than POINTER_GAZE_RETAKE, 5 deg, for 120 ms, with the mouse still
// for 300 ms) gives it back to the gaze; small eye movements around the pointer don't.
//   A left press while the gaze has the pointer isn't sent yet: the pointer stops where the
// gaze put it, and if the gaze is off, you drag it onto what you meant with the mouse
// (still holding the button; panels only see it hover). The release clicks there, a press
// and a release 40 ms apart. Held still for POINTER_GAZE_HOLD (0.5 s) instead, it becomes
// a real press where the pointer is, so drags work: hold, then move. After a click that
// didn't need correcting, and after a drag, the gaze has the pointer again.
//   Outside games (no scene application), gaze mode keeps the pointer: the relay doesn't
// release it when the mouse is idle ("gazeawake 1|0" tells it). A controller that moves
// still releases it (the mouse is gaze mode's only pointer device), and in games the mouse
// wakes it and idling releases it, as without gaze.
//   The dot only shows while the mouse moves it (within POINTER_GAZE_SHOW, 1 s), while a
// press is held, and briefly for each click (a pulse);
// otherwise it's transparent (still there for the laser to land on). The gaze moving it
// doesn't show it: you know where you're looking.
//   When the mouse took the pointer and you then click, the nudge was probably onto what
// you were looking at: from the raw gaze when the mouse took over to where you clicked is
// the tracker's error there. The helper sends it to ft-gazed as a lesson ("lesson <raw yaw>
// <raw pitch> <true yaw> <true pitch>", the true direction relative to the head as it was
// when the mouse took over) if the mouse moved between 0.2 deg and POINTER_GAZE_NUDGE_MAX
// (8 deg) and the click came within 10 s; more is using the mouse, not a nudge. A held
// press dragged onto the target is the same: from the raw gaze at the press to the release. With no
// fresh gaze (a blink, the service stopped, the headset off), the pointer stays put.
//
// Placement (for layout): SteamVR keeps a floating panel's position inside the
// dashboard, where nothing outside can set it, so the helper carries panels like a user
// would. It measures the panel (md::ScanPanel), aims the device at its grab bar
// (LAYOUT_GRAB_OFFSET, 7.5 cm below the bottom edge; the bands at 2-4 and 14-26 cm are
// other controls), presses, moves, and releases. While grabbed, the panel follows the
// device rigidly, except that the dashboard accelerates fast translations (0.1 m in 0.3 s
// moved it 0.19 m and turned it 8.5 deg, in jerky 25 ms steps right after the press). So
// the device hovers first, and the move is split into a rotation about the device origin
// (the eye) at 60 deg/s and a smooth 60 Hz slide at LAYOUT_SLIDE_SPEED (0.5 m/s; tested
// exact from 0.07 to 1 m/s). Scroll pushes along the panel normal, but only in whole notches of
// about 7 cm, so it isn't used. The result is measured again, and the move repeated up to
// twice while it's more than 1.5 cm or 1 deg off.
//
// Commands (datagrams on @ft_pointer_helper): show, hide, recenter, move <dyaw> <dpitch>,
// follow on|off|toggle (head follow, until the next restart or a change to POINTER_FOLLOW),
// gaze on|off|toggle|? (gaze mode, likewise with POINTER_GAZE; ? only asks), gz ... (the gaze, from ft-gazed),
// reload (re-read the settings below), debug (toggle a twice-a-second state log),
// vrbind/vrglobal/vrstatus (Frame controller buttons, see vrbuttons.h),
// and btn/scroll lines, which are forwarded to the driver unchanged. For layouts, with a
// reply datagram to the sender's (abstract) address:
//   place <overlay> <x> <y> <z> <yaw> <pitch> [roll [grab]]: centre in the standing
//     universe; the front faces back along the direction (yaw, pitch), turned by roll
//     (counterclockwise as seen, degrees) -> "ok ..." | "error ..."
//   measure <overlay> -> "ok cx cy cz width height xx xy xz yx yy yz zx zy zz" (centre,
//     size, and the panel's right, up, and front vectors)
//   head -> "ok x y z yaw pitch"
//   grabprobe <overlay>: log where below the panel SteamVR's laser hits something (to
//     find the grab bar again if a SteamVR update moves it)
//
// Settings (~/.config/frametop.conf): POINTER_DISTANCE (m, 1.5), POINTER_CURSOR_DEG
// (angular size of the dot, 0.4), POINTER_LASER_WIDTH (controller beam width to restore, 0.8),
// POINTER_ORIGIN_FRACTION (0.95): the laser starts this far along the eye-to-cursor line,
// but never closer than POINTER_ORIGIN_MARGIN (0.15 m) to the cursor point: SteamVR's
// small controls (undock, frame buttons) float a few centimetres in front of their
// panel, and a laser that starts behind them can't hit them. POINTER_FOLLOW (0) and
// POINTER_LEASH_DEG (10), POINTER_LEASH_DELAY (0.2 s), POINTER_LEASH_RETURN (0.2 s),
// POINTER_FOLLOW_REACH (70 deg): head follow, above. POINTER_GAZE (0), POINTER_GAZE_RETAKE
// (5 deg), POINTER_GAZE_NUDGE_MAX (8 deg), POINTER_GAZE_HOLD (0.5 s), POINTER_GAZE_SHOW (1 s):
